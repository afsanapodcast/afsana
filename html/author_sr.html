<p><img src="../images/sr.png" class="w3-circle border"/>Sandhya Rathore is an engineer, mother, daughter, sister, friend, and &mdash; in the midst of being all of these &mdash; a writer. She likes to dream; some of these have come true. She's been interested in writing since childhood. Over time, she's seen many faces of life &mdash; some good, some bad &mdash; and when she found herself unable to speak out, she wrote. With gusto. Her heart is that of a poet's &mdash; like glass. It's endured several cracks but she treasures it nevertheless. Her writings are but descriptions of events in life around her; it is her trifling attempt to string them through words.</p>
